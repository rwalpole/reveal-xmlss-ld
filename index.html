						What is knowledge?
						What is Oxford?
						Let's ask Chat GTP..
						We need more context?
						DIKW pyramind
						Justified true beliefs
						Formal knowledge Representation
						How do we share knowledge?
						Requires common language - syntax, semantics, taxonomy, thesauri, onotologies
						We use language to represent Knowledge
						Semiotic triangle
						Paraphrasing / ambiguity make langage difficult
						This makes it difficult for machines
						The machine must interpret the information correctly to "understand"
						Semantics is the study and interpretation of signs or symbols
						Semantics depends on context and pragmatics.
						If I say "I am going to Oxford" do I mean the town or the univeristy?
						It is likely to be interpreted based on the context.
						If I am speaking to a young person who has just passed their A levels I might assume that it it is the university.
						If I am speaking to an elderly American tourist then I might assume they are visiting the town.
						Pragmatics is the intention of a message for example "is there any coffee left?"
						We would interpret this question based on where we are.
						There is no need for us to say "do you know if there any coffee left in that coffee jug over there?"
						In a sentence you normally have subject predicate and object.
						For example:
						St Edmund Hall -> is in -> Oxford
						St Edmund Hall -> is part of -> Oxford university
						Terry Jones -> studied at -> St Edmund Hall
						subject -> predicate -> object
						node -> edge -> node = graph
						We can see that the edge is directed so we have a directed graph
						We can also see that the edge has a label so this means we have a directed edge-labeled graph
						Entities: St Edmunds Hall, Oxford, Oxford Univeristy
						Relations: is in, is part of, studied at
						Node == Entities
						Edges == relations
						Terry Jones -> born in -> XXXX
						Terry Jones -> died in -> XXXX
						These are not entities but literals
						Terry Jones is a Person
						Person is not an entity it is a class

						<h1>Knowledge Graphs</h1>
						> Show a larger graph
						Computer still does not understand the meaning
						Understanding has to be intrepetted by software by someone who can read the labels
						But things can change and then the software won't understand anymore
						Implicit vs Explicit Knowledge
						A knowledge graph generally describes real world entities and their relations, organized in a graph
						Defines classes and relations in a schema (explicit knowledge relations)
						Allows for potentially interrelating arbitary Entities
						Covers various topical domains
						Representing information as a graph is not new and has been used for a long time
						To avoid having to encode meaning into software we need an explicit knowledge Representation so that we have a representaion that can be "understood" by the computer without a human having to write specific code
						For this we have ontoglogies we are based on mathematical logic - this can then be used by a general inference engine or reasoner and there is no need to write specific code anymore
						Increasingly this understand can also be used by LLMs

						<h1>Identifying things with URIs</h1>
						What is this? Show a photo of an apple.
						Hopefully they sau "an apple".
						And then what is this? Show an actual apple.
						Hopefully they say "an apple".
						So what is the difference?
						One is a picture (not an apple) - and yet we also knew it was an apple.
						This is because humans can understand things by symbols.
						How do we make a computer understand the difference between things?
						On the web we can this with URIs A Uniform Resource Identifier.
						There are also IRIs which allow more diverse language and characterstics
						URI = schema / domain/host / path / fragment
						Normally on the web URIs are documents but how do we talk about apples?
						URLs = addresses for web documents
						URL identifies what exists on the web (document)
						URI identifies on the web what exists (anything)
						URI for an apple?
						http://example.org/apple
						http://example.org/Apfel
						http://example.org/pomme
						http://example.org/manzana
						What about Apple computers?
						We can have a language independent URI for example:
						https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q89 (apple the fruit)
						https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q312 (Apple the company)
						Apple has label en, de, fr, es (diagram)
						The apple itself cannot be on the web but we can describe the apple
						This is a designator (the URI) -> designatum (the apple) relationship
						When I access the URI I might get some representation of the apple, perhaps a web page or
						HTTP content negotiation allows you to chose the representation you want
						So you can ask for the content type you want (demo of http://wikidata.org./entity/Q39)
						curl -L -H "Accept: text/html" http://wikidata.org/entity/Q89
						curl -L -H "Accept: application/json" http://wikidata.org/entity/Q89
						curl -L -H "Accept: text/turtle" http://wikidata.org/entity/Q89

						<h1>Representing graphs and triples with RDF</h1>
						We already know how to represent facts with subject -> predicate -> object statements such as
						St Edmund Hall -- is in --> Oxford
						If we want to express this in RDF we need to use URIs
						Subject(URI) -> Property (URI) -> Object/Value (URI/Literal)
						e.g. dbr:University_of_Oxford dbo:location dbr:Oxford
						** show as a graph **
						In RDF the predicate is known as a Property
						** show Oxford as a graph with type and population ** (use https://www.w3.org/RDF/Validator/)
						XML schema types xsd:string, xsd:integer, xsd:nonNegativeInteger
						e.g. dbr:Oxford dbo:populationTotal "151584"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger
						Blank nodes (existence of individual but not named) - example?
						A RDF triple is a subject predicate object
						Subject can be a Blank node or a IRI
						Object is an IRI
						Subject can be a blank node, IRI or literals
						An RDF graph is a set of RDF triples
						Serialization formats
						N-triples (hard to read)
						RDF/XML (hard to read)
						N-Quads
						RDFa
						JSON-LD
						Notation3
						HDT
						HexTuples
						Turtle (abbreviated form or N-triples) - nice to read we will use this
						N-Triples to Turtle example
						Triples end with a .
						Subject can be continued with ;
						Terry Jones almaMater St Edmunds College;
												directed Monty Python and the Holy Grail
						predicate can be continued with ,
						Terry Jones directed Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Life of Brian, Meaning of Life

						Declare prefixes (syntatic sugar)
						Use @base &lt;Oxford&gt;
						N-ary relations
						Terry Jones directed film/date
						[] as subject (anonymous)
						[...] as object (nested anonymous blank nodes)
						Derefernceable blank nodes e.g. _:ID1 ?p ?o

						RDF Schema
						A high level vocabulary that allows us to define vocabularies
						Classes properties and instances
						Instances are indivual members of a class and can be instances of other classes
						If I want to describe a schema in RDF I need to use RDFS
						If I want to say something is a class I use rdf:type rdfs:Class
						If I want to say something is an instance I use rdf:type
						Properties are all instances of rdf:Property (not rdfs:Property)
						We can also definte rdfs:domain and rdfs:range
						Everything is a an rdfs:Resource
						rdfs:subClassOf
						rdfs:label
						rdfs:seeAlso
						rdfs:isDefinedBy
						rdfs:comment
						Example schema (class, property and instance definitions)
						Datatses that agree on vocabularies are more easily integrated - they speak the same Language
						Class is always uppercase, properties are always lower case

						<h1>The Semantic Web</h1>
						Semantic Web is an extenation of the WWW in which information is given well defined web as defined by TBL
						A kind of global database tha contains a network of semantic propositions
						At the bottom we have the URIs
						RDF allows us to encode triples
						OWL RDFS SKOS provide ways of modelling (also encoded in RDF)
						SPARQL can be used to query RDF based somewhat on SQL
						Demo of a SPARQL endpoint (DBpedia, Wikidata)
						Semantic Web technogy stack
						Meaning is made Explicit
						information can be processed automatically
						data can be integrata

						<h1>Linked Data / The Web of Data</h1>
						The traditionsal Web is or the web of documents is made up of HTML (representational language), HTTP (communications protocol) and URIs (identification and address)
						The web of data on the other hand is made up of URI HTTP and RDF
						The web of data is an upgrade of the web of documenets which "the web of human-readable is being merged.. " (quote from TBL)
						How do we access the Web of Data?
						You need a service
						https://lod-cloud.net/#
						Show the history of how the size has changed
						Traditionally data on the web was accessed via APIs but you had to know the schema and if something changed it would break your application
						There are differetnt APIs for different services. This creates data islands.
						Encoding the data as RDF means you have a generic interface with access over http
						The Linked Data principles
						5 star linked open data (from TBL)
						FAIR Principles - Linked Data complies to these principles
